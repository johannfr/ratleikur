This is a very simple Android/iOS (not tested on iOS) app for basically making a simple geocaching quest.

To edit the quest, simple edit the www/quests.json

Since www is the base-directory of the HTML content, all images are stored under www/img and then referenced using only the img/ as prefix on the JSON-file.

You then have to recompile the project.

Have fun!
